Basic Font Information

The MAP fonts were developed for the visual identity of the 7th edition of the Bolsa Pampulha program by Gabriel Figueiredo, who was then hired by JA.CA to coordinate for the edition's graphic design needs.

The fonts are based on the lettering on the Museu de Arte da Pampulha's fa√ßade, and are available both with static .OTF fonts (with 10 separate weights) and a dynamic .TTF(GX) variable font file.
